# Python Code Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python code examples that demonstrate various functionalities including arithmetic operations, data structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.

## Features

### Arithmetic Operations
Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with input from the user.

- **Functions**:
  - `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.
  - `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
  - `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b` (handles division by zero).

### Data Structures

- **List**: Demonstrates creating and printing a list.
- **Tuple**: Demonstrates creating and printing a tuple.
- **Dictionary**: Demonstrates creating and printing a dictionary with key-value pairs.

### Custom Functions

- `greet(name)`: Returns a greeting message for the given name.
- `calculate_square(num)`: Returns the square of the given number.

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **Class: Animal**
  - Attributes:
    - `name`: Name of the animal.
    - `species`: Species of the animal.
  - Methods:
    - `speak()`: Returns a greeting message from the animal.

### Miscellaneous

- `do_something(size, out_list)`: Appends even numbers (0 to `size*2`) to the provided list.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmed069/python-code-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to interact with the code.

## Outputs

### Arithmetic Operations
```plaintext
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0
```

### Data Structures
```plaintext
List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

### Custom Functions
```plaintext
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!
Enter a number to calculate its square: 4
The square of 4.0 is 16.0
```

### Object-Oriented Programming
```plaintext
Buddy says hello!
Whiskers says hello!
```
